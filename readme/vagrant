Vagrant 

vagrant creates the virtual machine (vm) with some OS and some configurations; one element of the vagrant box's configuration is the synced directory that Ansible provisions.

vagrant provision runs the ansible scripts in provisions/ckan/tasks
ansible consists of playbooks-roles-tasks, with default group_vars all/local overwriting local variables for a given role.


# random commands that are useful  (see also aliases in bashrc)
vagrant provision -- installs the environment
vagrant reload -- sets up the environment and server
vagrant ssh -- ssh into the virtual machine

sudo service httpd restart  -- restart apache server (can also try postgresql-9.3 and solr)
      
(local computer)  ->port 8080-> {vagrant-box ->port 80-> (apache[ckan/postgresql])}
If something goes wrong you should be able to curl localhost:80 from inside the vagrant box. If that works, you should be able to access localhost:8080 from your machine, and if not it could be an iptables issue (run chkconfig iptables off).
