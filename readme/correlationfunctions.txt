Correlation Functions (wp, xi)
Correlation function code can be found on jet at millenium/wpgood/ for projected and on mandor at uvb/correl/ for 3d... (and projected) 


The linklist construction is informative... the loop is:


lattice=linklist=-1
for(ip=0;ip<np;ip++){
        xc=x[ip];
        yc=y[ip];
        zc=z[ip];
        linklist[ip]=lattice[d3(xc,yc,zc)];
        lattice[d3(xc,yc,zc)]=ip;
}
The last particle inserted into LL is put into the lattice and linklist[lattice[d3(xc,yc,zc)]] calls the start of that linklist. so lattice is like the header for the linklist. Previous particle id's are pointed to by linklist until linklist[ip]=lattice[]=-1 when you get to the first particle that was inserted into the cell.
... maybe this is inefficient because points in the same cell have wildly varying ip's....
 
the mandor folder also has a cray that tells you how to make inputs for the millenium/wpgood folder's code and the mandor code.
