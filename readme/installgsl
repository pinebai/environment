Installing gsl
make sure all the prefixes are set correctly and then check the "shared libraries, staticically linked compilation". .h files are referred to in the LD_flags library thing in the .bashrc file
see for example:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Using-the-library.html
shared libraries and compiling and linking


to run the gsl random stuff: gcc a.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
