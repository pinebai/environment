PASSWORD STUFF (password)
ssh2: Ooga = OpenSSH, Booga = OpenSSH
First, generate a public/private DSA key pair on Ooga.

ooga% ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa         # passphrase, leave it empty.
ooga% scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub user@booga:~/.ssh
ooga% ssh booga
booga% cat .ssh/id_dsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys2
booga% rm -f .ssh/id_dsa.pub

Note that the filename is authorized_keys2, not authorized_keys. That's it;
you're ready to ssh from Ooga to Booga without having to enter a password.
