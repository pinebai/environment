simulate nonthermal pressure
-- no cooling field that contributes to the energy
------does *decay* on the turbulence dissipation timescale tau_dissipate~???
-- d ei_nt = -PdV ; P=ei_nt*(gamma'-1) 
------ d ei_nt/dV = -ei_nt*(gamma'-1)*dV 
dei = dQ-dW=-pdV+TdS 
dS=0
dei = -pdV
change in internal energy comes entirely from work done by the gas
if change in internal energy occurs because of anything else the internal energy MUST be compensated:
dei = -pgasdV -pcrdV 
pcr*dV is already subtracted from the internal energy above... put it back into the temperature here.
