int* p makes p a pointer to an integer address; 
* dereferences an address to get its value
so int* p = &i means the pointer p is pointing to address of i
the value of i is the dereferenced pointer; that value is *p

increment n and return it

#include <stdio.h>
void foo(int* n)
{
    (*n)++;
}
int main()
{
    int n = 0;
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        foo(&n);
        printf("%d\n", n);
    }
}
