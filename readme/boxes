12Mpc Box

/home/feldmann/RAMSES_IC_12MpcBox
1) Run Ramses from 12mpc box and compare hydro results?
--cooling curves, star formation prescriptions
here is the e-mail. I produced zoom-in ICs for several different galaxies, but I recommend to use the following files

*gf12A_mr2N9Rvir5* or
*gf12A_mr3N9Rvir5* .

Both correspond to the same z=0 MW halo, and only differ in the DM maximum refinement (2 additional levels vs 3 additional levels). I have been running gf12A_mr2N9Rvir5 with ART, so if you use these file it will allow for a fair comparison.

To run with RAMSES just include something like  
initfile(1)='path-to-IC/ic_n2_gf12A_mr3N9Rvir5_lev0'
initfile(2)='path-to-IC/ic_n2_gf12A_mr3N9Rvir5_lev1'
initfile(3)='path-to-IC/ic_n2_gf12A_mr3N9Rvir5_lev2'
initfile(4)='path-to-IC/ic_n2_gf12A_mr3N9Rvir5_lev3'
in the .nml file
