**dangers=undercooking potatoes and parsnips +adding cheese too early<br>
1 potato <br>
1 parsnip<br>
1 carrot<br>
1 onion<br>
3 mushrooms<br> 
1/3 of a red pepper<br>
2 garlic cloves<br>
1 corn cut from cob<br>
2 tablespoons of oil<br>
1/2 teaspoon of salt<br>
2/3 cup of grated cheese<br>
1 heat up oil 'till very hot<br>
2 slice garlic cloves into thin pieces<br> 
3 cut onion into medium slices<br>
4 put 1/2 onions and garlic into the pan<br>
5 slice potato into very thin slices<br>
6 place 1/2 potato into the pan<br>
7 layer onions and garlic over the potatoes then place the rest of the onions and garlic on top <br>

11 stir in sliced pepper, sliced mushrooms and corn let cook for 4 more minutes or until pepper is soft <br>
12 stir in the rest of the cheese for another ~2 minutes  <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Pesto:<br>
2 cups basil leaves<br>
3 garlic gloves (2 teaspoons)<br>
1 cup of pine nuts/walnuts or combo - grind up <br>
1 cup of olive oil slowly added <br>
1/2 cup parmesean and 1/2 romano (or 1 cup parm)<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Cheese Sauce not so complicated:  Heat about a cup or two cups of milk (depending on how much you want) stir about a tablespoon of cornstarch with a little cold milk then add it to the milk and keep stirring over the heat. It will begin to thicken. Add about a cup of grated cheese and a little salt and pepper and dry mustard (if you have it). It's ready when the cheese melts. If youbuy the corn starch it will tell you the exact proportions on the side of the packet.
<br>
Cheese Sauce Complicated: melt about 2 tablespoons of butter over low heat, add about 2 tablespoons of flour and keep stirring briskly until all the flour has been mixed in to the butter. keep stirring or whisking over low heat as you gradually add the milk (about 1 and ahalf cups). Increase the heat a bit and as you stir it will gradually thicken,add the grated cheese and S & P and dry mustard.<br>
