Window

Syntax: WINDOW nx ny x y

WINDOW makes the current plot location the window at (x,y), where there are nx
windows across and ny windows up and down. WINDOW 1 1 1 1 resets the plot location
to the entire plot area. The size and placement of the windows is decided by the
value of EXPAND when the WINDOW commands are issued, so be sure that EXPAND has the
same value for every window in a set. (It's used to figure out the axis labels, and
spacings between boxes). While plotting to a given window you can of course change
EXPAND to your heart's content.

If the number of windows in either the x or y direction is negative no space is
left between the boxes in that direction (try DO i=1,3 { WINDOW 1 -3 1 $i BOX }).
It's possible to overload `window' and `box' to only label external axes in blocks
of touching boxes.

If either x or y is specified as, e.g. 2:4, the window is set to cover the range 2-4
(i.e. the part of the screen covered by windows 2, 3, and 4). Note that this feature
can be used to split the screen in arbitrary ways, e.g.

window -1 -6 1 1:5 box
window -1 -6 1 6 box

(or you could say window -20 -20 15:19 15:19 as an alternative to a LOCATION
command).

If you don't want boxes that touch, but you don't like the gaps left between boxes
by the WINDOW command, you can now do something about it legally, without lying to
SM. After we calculate the widths of the `gutters' between the windows that we think
that you need, they are multiplied by the values of the SM variables x_gutter and
y_gutter, so if you think that the spacing is too large in the x direction you can
say

define x_gutter 0.5
window 2 2 1 1 box
window 2 2 1 2 box

to make things look better. Within a macro it can be convenient to say local
define x_gutter 0.5, as then the gutter value softly and suddenly vanishes at
the end of the macro.

It's confusing to change LOCATIONs while using WINDOWs; you probably want to say
WINDOW 1 1 1 1 first.
