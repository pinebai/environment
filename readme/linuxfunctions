latex ps eps
Using ps2epsi

The command ps2epsi can be used to convert a ps file to an eps file, e.g. give a
file called picture.ps it can be converted to an eps file with

ps2epsi picture.ps picture.epsi

This also adds to the file a bitmap preview image which is not really necessary.
You can thus remove it with the command

perl -ne 'print unless /^%%BeginPreview/../^%%EndPreview/' < picture.epsi >
picture.eps

Using Graphics packages
The convert tool from the ImageMagick package can convert between many different
image formats. To convert ps to eps try

convert file.ps file.eps

Alternatively use the display tool to display the image and then left click the
image to bring up a menu. From the menu you can crop the image and then save it as
an eps file.
