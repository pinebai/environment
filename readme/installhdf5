2. Quick installation
        For those who don't like to read ;-) the following steps can be used
        to configure, build, test, and install the HDF5 Library, header files,
        and support programs. For example, to install HDF5 version X.Y.Z at
        location /usr/local/hdf5, use the following steps.

            $ gunzip < hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xf -
            $ cd hdf5-X.Y.Z
            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 <more configure_flags>
            $ make
            $ make check                # run test suite.
            $ make install
            $ make check-install        # verify installation.
