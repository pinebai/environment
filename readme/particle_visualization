Visualization

Visualization of a Region
pb.cray creates plots of particle files   fulla:/d/scratch33/sleitner/nbodyART/COMP
outputs to region_plots and scps to leda:region_plots/ NOTE outputs only 1/4 files.
uses pbin_to_ascii.F
modify the position box
modify the FileName1/2 names

The Opaqueness of the Polygon

The opaqueness of the polygon can be set using the alpha command. alpha takes on values between 0 and 1 with a default of 0.5. A value of 0 corresponds to zero opaqueness (complete transparency or invisibility) and a value of 1 corresponds to a polygon that is completely opaque. A value of 0.999 will make the polygon quite bright without making it fully opaque, blocking your view of everything behind it. Try setting alpha to 0.2 to see more transparent polygons.

p3d for Tipsy ===========================================================

p3d

FOR TIPSY:
Including marcel stuff
link file to /lustre/sleitner/halo/marcel/DAT/
cd /lustre/sleitner/halo/marcel/tools/ and run all.cray (or modify the ls *hydro06* for loop)
Create Halo Catalog:
cd halo/carthc/
link to DAT if it's not already there
make a new all.cray or copy one there and run it
send hlist, rho_smooth, p_a to asdf:research/p3d/badendian
or cd /lustre/cart/utils/cart_analysis to create halo catalog 
prep.cray
Visualize with p3d
exit to asdf:
go to research/p3d/ run fixendian.cray
run graph.cray
gv or gimp the gif file the output in plots
note the graph.cray box side is just a label, the true box size is set in demo.h




What files do we need?
rho_smoot
hlist
visualize in p3d (gthumb convert)
This example was used to evaluate high-res simulation of CL6:
logrus:/mnt/avalon/data/andrey/CLUSTER6_HR/CLUSTER6_HR/HF

the files are demo1.f and p3d.f - you can look at demo1.f to see what
it's doing. It's using the particle densities generated by smooth and
coordinates from PM*DAT file to create 3D projection. Highest
density particles are plotted first so they are never blocked by lower-res
ones.

In that directory there are gif files generated with demo1.f
File mov1.pl there shows a perl script that can be used to run the
same code on multiple epochs.

It should be straightforward to use, but you can also look at
the base code that I had available for people to download as well -
the main program there is a bit better described:
