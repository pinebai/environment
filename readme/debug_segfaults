nick segfaults segmentation faults

You need to find first where the segfaults occurs. 

If add #define DEBUG in defs.h, it will create debug.###.log files for you and will write every timer on/off switch. 
That way you can find between which two timer calls the code segfaults. 
To do finer level debugging, you can insert SET_MARKER(int) calls in your code, they will leave a record in debug.###.log as well.
